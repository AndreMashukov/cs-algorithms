Problem: Minimum Cost For Tickets (DP Approach)

Q1: 2
The DP array represents the minimum cost up to each day, allowing us to build the solution incrementally.

Q2: 2
For a non-travel day, the cost remains the same as the previous day since no additional pass is needed.

Q3: 2
The travelDays set is used to keep track of travel days for quick lookup, ensuring we only calculate costs for those days.

Q4: 1
The DP approach uses a loop to try each pass duration and calculates the cost accordingly.

Q5: 2
The final result of the DP approach is the minimum cost to cover all travel days, found at the last index of the DP array.

Q6: 2
The cost for a 7-day pass is calculated by adding the pass cost to the cost 7 days before, covering the travel period.

Q7: 2
The DP approach is suitable because it allows for systematic cost calculation, 
efficiently handling overlapping subproblems.
