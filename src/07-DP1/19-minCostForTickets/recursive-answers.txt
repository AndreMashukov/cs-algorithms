Problem: Minimum Cost For Tickets (DFS with Memoization)

Q1: 2
The memoization map caches already computed results to avoid redundant calculations.

Q2: 2
The base case is when all days are covered, meaning no more cost is needed.

Q3: 2
The next day index is determined by finding the next uncovered day after the current pass expires.

Q4: 2
The variable 'res' represents the minimum cost calculated so far.

Q5: 1
The DFS function uses a loop to try each pass duration and calculates the cost accordingly.

Q6: 2
If a result is already cached, the DFS function returns the cached result to save computation time.

Q7: 2
The DFS approach is suitable because it allows for easy memoization, which optimizes the recursive solution.
