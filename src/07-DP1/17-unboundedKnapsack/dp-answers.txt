Problem: Unbounded Knapsack (DP Approach)

Q1: 2
The DP array represents the maximum profit up to each capacity, allowing us to build the solution incrementally.

Q2: 3
The profit for a capacity is calculated based on the current item and previous capacities, considering all options.

Q3: 2
The nested loops iterate over items and capacities to fill the DP table with maximum profits.

Q4: 1
The DP approach uses a loop to try each item and calculates the profit accordingly.

Q5: 2
The final result of the DP approach is the maximum profit for the given capacity, found at the last index of the DP array.

Q6: 1
The profit for including an item is calculated by adding the item's profit to the profit of the remaining capacity after including the item.

Q7: 2
The DP approach is suitable because it allows for systematic profit calculation, efficiently handling overlapping subproblems.
