Problem: Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum (Dynamic Programming)

Q1: What traversal method is used in the DP solution and why?
1. Pre-order traversal to process parents before children
2. In-order traversal to process nodes in sorted order
3. Post-order traversal to process children before parents
4. Level-order traversal to process nodes level by level

Q2: What does the dpDown Map store for each node?
1. The maximum path sum in the entire subtree rooted at that node
2. The maximum path sum starting from that node going downward
3. The number of nodes in the subtree rooted at that node
4. The depth of the node in the tree

Q3: In the explicit DP approach, what does maxThroughPath represent?
1. The maximum path that goes through the node connecting both subtrees
2. The maximum path that starts from the node and goes down
3. The maximum path that ends at the node coming from above
4. The maximum path that goes around the node

Q4: Why do we need both maxDownPath and maxThroughPath in the explicit DP approach?
1. maxDownPath is for parents to use, maxThroughPath is for global maximum
2. maxDownPath is for left children, maxThroughPath is for right children
3. maxDownPath is for positive sums, maxThroughPath is for negative sums
4. maxDownPath is for internal nodes, maxThroughPath is for leaf nodes

Q5: How does the DP approach handle negative path sums?
1. It ignores all negative values completely
2. It uses Math.max(0, sum) to avoid including negative contributions
3. It converts negative values to positive
4. It removes nodes with negative values from the tree

Q6: What is the time complexity of the DP solution?
1. O(n log n) where n is the number of nodes
2. O(nÂ²) where n is the number of nodes
3. O(n) where n is the number of nodes
4. O(h) where h is the height of the tree

Q7: In the calculation "node.val + Math.max(0, leftState.maxDownPath) + Math.max(0, rightState.maxDownPath)", what constraint does this satisfy?
1. It ensures the path sum is always positive
2. It ensures we include both subtrees in the path
3. It ensures we only include beneficial (non-negative) subtree contributions
4. It ensures the path doesn't exceed a certain length
