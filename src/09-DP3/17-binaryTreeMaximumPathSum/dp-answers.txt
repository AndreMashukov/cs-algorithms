Problem: Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum (Dynamic Programming)

Q1: 3
Post-order traversal is used because we need to calculate results for children before we can determine the optimal path for the parent.

Q2: 2
The dpDown Map stores the maximum path sum starting from each node going downward, which can be used by parent nodes.

Q3: 1
maxThroughPath represents the maximum path that goes through the node, potentially connecting both left and right subtrees.

Q4: 1
maxDownPath is used by parent nodes to extend paths upward, while maxThroughPath is used to update the global maximum.

Q5: 2
The DP approach uses Math.max(0, sum) to avoid including negative contributions that would decrease the total path sum.

Q6: 3
The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes, since we visit each node exactly once.

Q7: 3
This calculation ensures we only include beneficial (non-negative) subtree contributions to maximize the path sum.
