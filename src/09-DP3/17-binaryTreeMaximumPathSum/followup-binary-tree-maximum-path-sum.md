Based on the error in your logic in `mistakes.js`, the issue isn't with the dynamic programming concept itselfâ€”your `preorder` function is logically sound. The fundamental gap is in the **function's execution control flow**. You've correctly defined the recursive logic, but you haven't initiated it or returned its result.

Here are two questions to probe that understanding:

1.  Inside the `maxPathSum` function, you define the `preorder` helper. What line of code is needed to start the recursive calculation on the tree, and where should it be placed?
2.  The `max` variable is designed to hold the final answer. After the entire tree has been traversed, how does the `maxPathSum` function provide this value back to whoever called it?

> That's a bit embarrassing, but it makes perfect sense. I built the recursive logic but forgot to actually call it and return the result. Can you give me a simple tree and I'll write out the complete, corrected `maxPathSum` function body to show I understand?

Absolutely. It's a common mistake to focus on the complex part and miss the simple connections.

Let's use the tree: `root = [1, 2, 3]`

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
```

Please provide the complete and corrected code for the `maxPathSum` function that would solve this.
