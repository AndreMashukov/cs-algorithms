Great question! Both problems—**Wildcard Matching** (`dfs.js`) and **Regular Expression Matching** (`regexpMatchingDfs.js`)—involve matching a string against a pattern, but the rules for the pattern syntax are different. Here’s a clear comparison:

---

### 1. Wildcard Matching (LeetCode 44, your `dfs.js`)

**Pattern Syntax:**
- `?` matches **any single character**.
- `*` matches **any sequence of characters** (including the empty sequence).

**Example:**
- Pattern: `a*?b`
- String: `axxxxb`
- Match: Yes (`*` matches `xxxx`, `?` matches `b`)

**Key Points:**
- `*` can match zero or more of **any** character.
- `?` is a single-character wildcard.

---

### 2. Regular Expression Matching (LeetCode 10, your `regexpMatchingDfs.js`)

**Pattern Syntax:**
- `.` matches **any single character**.
- `*` matches **zero or more of the preceding element** (not any character, but the one before `*`).

**Example:**
- Pattern: `a*b`
- String: `aaab`
- Match: Yes (`a*` matches `aaa`, then `b` matches `b`)

**Key Points:**
- `*` is always tied to the character (or `.`) before it, and means "zero or more of that".
- `.` is a single-character wildcard.

### **Summary Table**

| Feature         | Wildcard Matching (`?`, `*`) | Regexp Matching (`.`, `*`)         |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Single wildcard | `?` (any char)               | `.` (any char)                     |
| Star meaning    | `*` (any sequence, any char) | `*` (zero/more of prev char/dot)   |
| Example         | `a*?b`                       | `a*b`                              |
| Pattern power   | Simpler, more "glob" style   | More like real regex, more precise |

### **In Code**

- In **Wildcard Matching**, `*` can match any number of any characters, and `?` matches one character.
- In **Regexp Matching**, `*` only applies to the character before it (including `.`), and `.` matches any single character.

---

**In short:**  
- Wildcard Matching is like shell globbing (`*`, `?`).
- Regexp Matching is like simplified regular expressions (`.`, `*`).
