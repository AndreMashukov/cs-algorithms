Based on the errors in your solution, the fundamental concepts that seem to be misunderstood are **loop boundary conditions** for substrings and how to correctly **handle the base case** when constructing results in a recursive function.

Let's clarify this with a couple of questions.

***

### Conceptual Probe

**Question 1:** In your `for` loop, you iterate with `endIndex` to define the end of a potential word. If your string `s` is `"cat"` and `startIndex` is `0`, what is the final value of `endIndex` your loop will check? Will `s.substring(startIndex, endIndex)` ever be equal to `"cat"`?

**Question 2:** When your recursive call `dfs(endIndex)` successfully reaches the end of the string, it correctly returns `[""]`. In your code, when `sentence` is `""`, what do you add to the `result` array? Should you be adding the empty string, or the `currentWord` that led to this successful path?

### "What If" Scenario

That makes sense. Now that we've reviewed the loop boundaries and base case handling, let's apply it to a scenario where your current code would fail.

Consider the simplest possible test case: `s = "a"` and `wordDict = ["a"]`.

The correct output should be `["a"]`.

Could you trace how your current code executes for this input? Pay close attention to the `for` loop's condition. Why does your function produce an empty array `[]` instead of the correct answer?
