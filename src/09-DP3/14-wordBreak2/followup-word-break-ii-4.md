Based on the errors in your new solution, the fundamental concept that seems to be misunderstood is **how to use the results of subproblems to build up a solution** in dynamic programming. You are correctly iterating and identifying valid words, but you are modifying the wrong part of your `dp` table.

Let's clarify this with a couple of questions.

***

### Conceptual Probe

**Question 1:** In a bottom-up DP approach, `dp[j]` holds the pre-computed, correct answer for the subproblem starting at index `j`. When you are calculating the result for `dp[i]` (where `i < j`), should you ever *change* the value of `dp[j]`?

**Question 2:** Your code is trying to build the list of all possible sentences for the substring starting at `i`. Where should the new sentences you construct (e.g., `curWord + " " + sent`) be stored? Should they be added to `dp[j]` or to a temporary list that will eventually become `dp[i]`?

### "What If" Scenario

That makes sense. Now that we've reviewed how to use the subproblem results, let's trace a scenario where your current code fails.

Consider the input `s = "catsand"` and `wordDict = ["cat", "sand"]`.

The correct `dp` table should be built as follows:
- `dp[7]` = `[""]`
- `dp[3]` = `["sand"]`
- `dp[0]` = `["cat sand"]`

Could you trace how your current code executes when the outer loop is at `i = 0`?
1.  The inner loop will eventually find `curWord = "cat"` when `j = 3`.
2.  It then checks `dp[3]`, which contains `["sand"]`.
3.  What does your code do inside the `for (let sent of dp[j])` loop?
4.  Which array (`dp[0]` or `dp[3]`) gets modified? What is the final value of `dp[0]`?

This trace should reveal why your function returns an incorrect result.
