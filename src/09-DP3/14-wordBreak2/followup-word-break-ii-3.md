Based on the errors in your new solution, the fundamental concepts that seem to be misunderstood are **how to define the base case** in a recursive function and **how to correctly order the results** from recursive calls.

Let's clarify this with a couple of questions.

***

### Conceptual Probe

**Question 1:** A recursive function needs a base case to stop. In this problem, what does it mean for the `dfs(start)` function to have successfully reached a valid end-point? What should the value of `start` be when the *entire* string has been successfully broken down into words? What should the function return in that specific scenario to signal success to the previous call?

**Question 2:** Your code for combining results is `result.push(sent + " " + currentWord)`. If `currentWord` is `"cat"` and the recursive call for the remainder returns `sent = "sand dog"`, what sentence does your code produce? Is this the correct order for the final sentence?

### "What If" Scenario

That makes sense. Now that we've reviewed the base case and result construction, let's apply it to a scenario where your current code would fail.

Consider the input `s = "catsand"` and `wordDict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand"]`.

The correct output should include `"cat sand"`.

Could you trace how your current code executes to produce this result? 
1. What happens when the initial `dfs(0)` call finds the `currentWord = "cat"`?
2. What is the `start` index for the next recursive call `dfs(end)`?
3. What does that recursive call eventually return?
4. How does your code combine `"cat"` with the result from the recursive call?

What is the final sentence you get, and why is it incorrect?
