Based on the error in your logic in `word-break-mistakes.js`, the fundamental concept of dynamic programming that seems to be misunderstood is how to correctly **combine the results of subproblems**. Your DP state and transitions are well-structured, but the error lies in the step where you construct new sentences from existing ones.

Here are two questions to test your understanding of that concept:

1.  In your DP approach, `dp[i]` is meant to store all possible valid sentences for the suffix of the string starting at index `i`. When you find a valid word `s.substring(i, j)`, how do you determine whether or not to add a space after it before appending a sentence from `dp[j]`?
2.  Your base case, `dp[n]`, correctly represents the solution for an empty string. How does the value you chose for `dp[n]` (i.e., `[""]`) help you differentiate between a word that ends a sentence versus a word that appears in the middle of one?

> That makes sense. I understand now that I need to be careful about how I combine the subproblem results, especially handling the base case correctly to avoid issues like trailing spaces. Can you give me a new, small test case for "Word Break II" where this distinction is important? Let me try to solve it.

Of course. Let's test this refined understanding.

Consider the following simple test case for Word Break II:
*   `s = "catsand"`
*   `wordDict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand"]`

Please trace how your logic would build the result for `dp[0]`. What would be the final output? This case is designed to check how you combine a prefix word ("cats") with a suffix word ("and").
