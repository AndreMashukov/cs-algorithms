Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III (DFS with Memoization)

Q1: 2
The 'transactions' parameter represents the number of completed buy-sell pairs, where each pair counts as one transaction.

Q2: 1
Day 2, holding stock (1), with 1 transaction completed would be represented as "2-1-1".

Q3: 2
We increment transactions by 1 when selling because selling stock completes a buy-sell transaction pair.

Q4: 3
When transactions >= 2, we return 0 because we've reached the maximum allowed transactions and no more profit is possible.

Q5: 2
With holding=0 and transactions=1, we can either buy at the current price (4) or skip this day.

Q6: 1
We don't increment transactions when buying because buying only starts a transaction - it's not completed until we sell.

Q7: 1
Each memoization key is unique and will only be computed once due to memoization, so there's only 1 recursive call per key.
