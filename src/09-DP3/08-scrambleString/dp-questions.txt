Problem: Scramble String (Dynamic Programming)

Q1: What does dp[len][i][j] represent in the 3D DP table?
1. Whether s1[i] equals s2[j] for length len
2. Whether s1.substring(i, i+len) can be scrambled to form s2.substring(j, j+len)
3. The number of ways to scramble s1[i:i+len] into s2[j:j+len]
4. The minimum operations to transform s1[i:i+len] into s2[j:j+len]

Q2: How is the base case dp[1][i][j] initialized?
1. Always set to true for valid indices
2. Set to true if s1[i] == s2[j], false otherwise
3. Set to false for all positions initially
4. Set based on character frequency comparison

Q3: In the DP approach, for length len=3, split point k=1, what represents the "no swap" case?
1. dp[1][i][j] && dp[2][i+1][j+1]
2. dp[1][i][j+2] && dp[2][i+1][j]
3. dp[3][i][j] = dp[1][i][j] || dp[2][i+1][j+1]
4. dp[1][i][j] && dp[2][i+1][j+2]

Q4: For the swap case with split point k, what indices are used for the right part comparison?
1. dp[len-k][i+k][j]
2. dp[len-k][i+k][j+k]
3. dp[len-k][i][j+len-k]
4. dp[len-k][i+len-k][j]

Q5: What is the order of filling the DP table?
1. Fill all lengths from 1 to n, for each length fill all valid (i,j) pairs
2. Fill all (i,j) pairs first, then process each length
3. Fill diagonally from top-left to bottom-right
4. Fill randomly as all states are independent

Q6: Why does the algorithm check both swap and no-swap cases for each split point?
1. To optimize time complexity
2. Because the original scrambling algorithm allows both operations
3. To handle edge cases with single characters
4. To ensure the DP table is completely filled

Q7: What value is returned as the final answer?
1. dp[n][0][n-1]
2. dp[n-1][0][0]
3. dp[n][0][0]
4. The maximum value in dp[n]
