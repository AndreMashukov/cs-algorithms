I'll explain the split mechanism for the scramble string problem 
with a simple example. 
Let me first look at the implementation to understand the exact logic.
Now let me explain the split mechanism with a simple example.
I'll use a clear, step-by-step illustration:

## Scramble String: Split Mechanism Explained

The key insight is that when we scramble a string, we can either **keep the order**
 or **swap the parts** after splitting.

### Simple Example: `s1 = "abc"`, `s2 = "bac"`

Let's see how we try different split points and check both cases:

#### **Split at position 1** (i=1):
```
s1 = "abc" → left1="a", right1="bc"
s2 = "bac" → left2="b", right2="ac"
```

**Case 1 - No Swap:** Check if structure matches without swapping
- Does `"a" == "b"`? No ❌
- Does `"bc" == "ac"`? No ❌
- **Result:** No swap case fails

**Case 2 - With Swap:** Check if left1 matches 
the "swapped right part" of s2
- `left2_swapped = s2.substring(s2.length - i) = "bac".substring(2) = "c"`
- `right2_swapped = s2.substring(0, s2.length - i) = "bac".substring(0,2) = "ba"`
- Does `"a" == "c"`? No ❌
- Does `"bc" == "ba"`? No ❌  
- **Result:** Swap case fails

#### **Split at position 2** (i=2):
```
s1 = "abc" → left1="ab", right1="c"  
s2 = "bac" → left2="ba", right2="c"
```

**Case 1 - No Swap:**
- Does `"ab" == "ba"`? No ❌
- Does `"c" == "c"`? Yes ✅
- **Result:** No swap case fails (both must be true)

**Case 2 - With Swap:**
- `left2_swapped = "bac".substring(3-2) = "bac".substring(1) = "ac"`
- `right2_swapped = "bac".substring(0,1) = "b"`
- Does `"ab"` scramble to `"ac"`? No ❌
- Does `"c" == "b"`? No ❌
- **Result:** Swap case fails

### Visual Representation of the Swap Logic:

```
Original split (No Swap):
s1: [left1] [right1]
s2: [left2] [right2]
Check: left1 ↔ left2  AND  right1 ↔ right2

Swapped split (With Swap):  
s1: [left1] [right1]
s2: [right2_swapped] [left2_swapped]
Check: left1 ↔ left2_swapped  AND  right1 ↔ right2_swapped

Where:
- left2_swapped = last i characters of s2
- right2_swapped = first (length-i) characters of s2
```

### Why This Works:

When scrambling creates a string, it can either:
1. **Keep order**: `"ab" + "c"` stays as `"abc"`
2. **Swap parts**: `"ab" + "c"` becomes `"c" + "ab"` = `"cab"`

So when checking if `s2` could come from scrambling `s1`, 
we need to test both possibilities at every split point.

The algorithm tries all possible split points and for each split,
 checks both the "no swap" and "swap" scenarios
  recursively until it either finds a valid scrambling 
  path or exhausts all possibilities.



Problem: Scramble String (Recursive with Memoization)

Let's trace through isScramble_dfs("abc", "bca") step by step:

Step 1: Initial call dfs("abc", "bca")
- Create key "abc#bca"
- Check memo: not found
- s1 != s2, so continue
- Lengths are equal (3), so continue
- Check character frequencies:
  - s1: {a:1, b:1, c:1}
  - s2: {b:1, c:1, a:1}
  - Frequencies match, so continue

Step 2: Try split point i=1
- left1 = "a", right1 = "bc"
- left2 = "b", right2 = "ca"

Step 3: No-swap case - dfs("a", "b") && dfs("bc", "ca")
- Call dfs("a", "b"):
  - s1 != s2, lengths equal
  - Frequencies: {a:1} vs {b:1} - don't match
  - Return false
- Since first part is false, no-swap case fails

Step 4: Swap case - dfs("a", "ca") && dfs("bc", "b")
- Call dfs("a", "ca"):
  - Lengths different (1 vs 2)
  - Return false
- Since first part is false, swap case fails

Step 5: Try split point i=2
- left1 = "ab", right1 = "c"
- left2 = "bc", right2 = "a"

Step 6: No-swap case - dfs("ab", "bc") && dfs("c", "a")
- Call dfs("ab", "bc"):
  - Lengths equal, frequencies: {a:1,b:1} vs {b:1,c:1} - don't match
  - Return false
- Since first part is false, no-swap case fails

Step 7: Swap case - dfs("ab", "a") && dfs("c", "bc")
- Call dfs("ab", "a"):
  - Lengths different (2 vs 1)
  - Return false
- Since first part is false, swap case fails

Step 8: All split points tried, return false
- Store memo["abc#bca"] = false
- Return false

Final Result: false (s2="bca" is not a scrambled version of s1="abc")

Note: If we had tried "abc" and "acb", we would find a valid scrambling at split point i=2 with the swap case.
