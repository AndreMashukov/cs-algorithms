Based on the error in your new solution, the fundamental concept that seems to be misunderstood is how a **Dynamic Programming state transition** should be structured. Your code correctly identifies the parent cells, but the way you combine their values is flawed.

Let's clarify this with a couple of questions.

### Conceptual Probe

**Question 1:** When calculating the minimum path sum to reach `triangle[i][j]`, how many times should the value of `triangle[i][j]` itself be added to the total path sum for that specific path?

**Question 2:** The correct formula for an internal cell is `dp[i][j] = triangle[i][j] + Math.min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j])`. Notice the order of operations: the `min` is found first, and then `triangle[i][j]` is added *once*. How does your code's structure differ from this, and why might it lead to adding `triangle[i][j]` more than once?

### "What If" Scenario

That makes sense. Now that we've reviewed the structure of the calculation, let's apply it to a scenario where your current code would fail.

Consider this new triangle:
```
[ [1],
  [10, 1],
  [10, 1, 10] ]
```
The correct minimum path is `1 -> 1 -> 1`, with a sum of `3`.

Could you trace how your current code would calculate the `dp` table for this triangle? Pay close attention to the calculation for `dp[2][1]` (the middle `1` in the last row). What would the final result be, and why is it incorrect?
