Problem: Triangle (DFS with Memoization)

Q1: 2
We can move to the same column (row+1, col) or the next column (row+1, col+1) in the next row.

Q2: 3
The key uniquely identifies a position (row, col) in the triangle for memoization lookup.

Q3: 4
At the last row, we return the triangle value at current position since no further moves are possible.

Q4: 1
We add the current position's value to accumulate the total path sum from top to bottom.

Q5: 2
Starting from the top of triangle, we begin the recursive computation to find minimum path to bottom.

Q6: 2
Due to recursion, we go deep first, so the last row values (4,5,6) are computed before backtracking.

Q7: 2
After memoization, it stores the minimum path sum from position (2,1) to reach the bottom of triangle.
