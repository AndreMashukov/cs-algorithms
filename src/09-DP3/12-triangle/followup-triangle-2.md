Based on the error in your new solution, the fundamental concept that seems to be misunderstood is the **state transition relationship** in dynamic programming. Specifically, your code is not correctly identifying which previously computed subproblems are needed to solve the current subproblem.

Let's clarify this with a couple of questions.

***

### Conceptual Probe

**Question 1:** The problem states you can move from a cell at `(row, col)` to either `(row+1, col)` or `(row+1, col+1)`. If we are working top-down to fill our `dp` table, this means to calculate the minimum path to `dp[i][j]`, we must have come from the row above (`i-1`). Which two cells in the previous row (`i-1`) are the only valid parents for the cell at `(i, j)`?

**Question 2:** Your second `if` block uses the value `dp[i][j-1]` to calculate `dp[i][j]`. What path does `dp[i][j-1]` represent? According to the problem's movement rules (only down or down-right), can a path to the cell on the left (`j-1`) ever be part of an optimal path to the current cell (`j`)?

### "What If" Scenario

That makes sense. Now that we've reviewed the correct state dependencies, let's apply it to a scenario where your current code would fail.

Consider this new triangle:
```
[ [10],
  [1, 100],
  [100, 1, 100] ]
```
The correct minimum path is `10 -> 1 -> 1`, with a sum of `12`.

Could you trace how your current code would calculate the `dp` table for this triangle? Pay close attention to what happens on the left edge (`j=0`) and how `dp[1][1]` is calculated. What would the final result be, and why is it incorrect?
