Problem: Number of Digit One (Dynamic Programming)

Q1: 2
higher = floor(1234/1000) = 1, cur = floor(1234/100)%10 = 2, lower = 1234%100 = 34

Q2: 2
At tens position of 213: cur=1, so we add lower+1 = 3+1 = 4 (not factor=10)

Q3: 2
At tens: higher=10, cur=1, lower=5. Since cur=1, add lower+1 = 5+1 = 6

Q4: 1
This counts all 1s at the current digit position that occur in complete cycles as higher digits vary from 0 to (higher-1)

Q5: 1
The loop continues while factor <= n. For n=111: factor=1, 10, 100 (stops at 1000 since 1000 > 111)

Q6: 1
When the current digit is 1, we count from 0 to lower (inclusive), which is lower+1 numbers total

Q7: 2
At tens: higher=0, cur=9, lower=9. Count = 0*10 + 10 = 10 (since cur>1, we add factor)
