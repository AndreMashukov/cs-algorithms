Answers for "Number of Digit One (Digit Dynamic Programming)":

Q1: 3
The tight parameter ensures we don't generate numbers exceeding 
the input number by constraining digit choices when necessary.

Q2: 2
newTight becomes false when we choose any digit 
less than the maximum allowed digit (maxDigit) at the current position, 
which gives us freedom in subsequent positions.

Q3: 2
When we choose digit 1 at position 0 (making 1_), 
tight becomes false as 1<2, allowing us to use any digit (0-9) at position 1, 
resulting in numbers 10-19.

Q4: 4
The tight parameter remains true only if it was already true AND 
we choose exactly the maximum allowed digit (tight && digit === maxDigit).

Q5: 3
The tight parameter ensures we only count valid numbers 
â‰¤13 by preventing us from counting invalid numbers 
like 14-19 that exceed the input.

Q6: 2
Including tight in the memoization key is necessary because the result differs depending on whether we're still bounded by the original number's constraints.

Q7: 3
When tight=true, our digit choices are constrained to ensure we stay within the bounds of the original number; otherwise, we could generate invalid numbers.
