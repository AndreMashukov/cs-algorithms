Problem: Number of Digit One (Dynamic Programming)

Q1: For n=1234 and factor=100, what are the values of higher, cur, and lower?
1. higher=12, cur=3, lower=34
2. higher=1, cur=2, lower=34
3. higher=12, cur=2, lower=34
4. higher=1, cur=3, lower=4

Q2: When processing the tens position (factor=10) for n=213, why do we add exactly 'factor' to the count?
1. Because cur=1, so we add lower+1 = 3+1 = 4
2. Because cur>1, so we add the full cycle of 10 ones
3. Because there are 10 digits (0-9)
4. Because higher=21 and we multiply by 10

Q3: For n=1015, when factor=10 (tens position), what is added to the count for the current digit contribution?
1. 0
2. 6
3. 10
4. 15

Q4: In the formula count += higher * factor, what does this represent?
1. The number of 1s at the current position from all complete cycles of higher digits
2. The total value contributed by higher digits
3. The number of times we've seen the digit 1 so far
4. The maximum possible 1s at this position

Q5: For n=111, how many times does the loop iterate, and what are the factor values?
1. 3 times: 1, 10, 100
2. 4 times: 1, 10, 100, 1000
3. 3 times: 1, 11, 111
4. 2 times: 1, 10

Q6: When cur === 1, why do we add (lower + 1) instead of just lower?
1. To include the current number itself when it has 1 at the current position
2. To handle the edge case of n=0
3. To compensate for 0-indexing
4. To count the digit 1 twice

Q7: For n=99, what is the total contribution from the tens position (factor=10)?
1. 9
2. 10
3. 18
4. 19
