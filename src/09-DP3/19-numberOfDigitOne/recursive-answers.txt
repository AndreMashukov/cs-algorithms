Problem: Number of Digit One (DFS with Memoization)

Q1: 2
Choosing 2 > 1 (the max digit at position 0 for n=13) makes tight=false, allowing any digit 0-9 in subsequent positions

Q2: 2
The count parameter tracks the number of 1s accumulated in the current number being constructed during the recursion

Q3: 2
Since we're at position 1 with tight=true and n=213, the maximum digit is str[1] = '1', so we can choose 0 or 1

Q4: 1
The count parameter accumulates all 1s found while building the current number, and at the base case, it represents the total for that number

Q5: 3
This state can be reached through multiple paths when different combinations of previous digits lead 
to the same position with tight=false and one 1 already counted

Q6: 1
newTight remains true only when we were already under tight constraint AND we chose the maximum allowed digit

Q7: 3
For n=11 (2 digits), we explore various combinations of (pos, tight, count), but due to the small number, there are less than 20 unique states
