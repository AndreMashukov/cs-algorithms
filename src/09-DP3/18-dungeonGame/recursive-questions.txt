Problem: Dungeon Game (DFS with Memoization)

Q1: When solving the dungeon [[−2,−3,3],[−5,−10,1],[10,30,−5]], what is the first base case value that gets computed and cached in the memoization map?
1. 7 for position (0,0)
2. 6 for position (2,2)
3. 1 for position (2,1)
4. 4 for position (1,2)

Q2: In the recursive solution, why do we calculate currentMinHealth as Math.max(1, minHealthNeeded - dungeon[i][j])?
1. To ensure the knight always has positive health after accounting for the current room's effect
2. To maximize the health gained from magic orbs
3. To minimize the path length to the princess
4. To avoid negative array indices

Q3: For dungeon [[−3,5]], starting at position (0,0), what sequence of calculations occurs in the DFS traversal?
1. dfs(0,0) → dfs(0,1) → dfs(0,2) returns Infinity → base case at (0,1)
2. dfs(0,0) → dfs(1,0) returns Infinity → dfs(0,1) → base case
3. dfs(0,0) → dfs(0,1) → base case → calculate health for (0,0)
4. dfs(0,0) → calculate health directly without recursion

Q4: When the algorithm encounters a room with value 30 (like position (2,1) in the first example), how does this affect the minimum health calculation?
1. It reduces the minimum health needed from that position by 30
2. It sets the minimum health to exactly 30
3. It adds 30 to the total path cost
4. It guarantees the knight survives with exactly 1 health

Q5: In the memoization approach, if we call dfs(1,1) multiple times during execution, what happens after the first call?
1. The function recalculates the entire subtree from (1,1)
2. It immediately returns the cached value without further recursion
3. It updates the cached value with a new calculation
4. It checks if the path has changed since last computation

Q6: For a 1x1 dungeon [[x]], what is the formula for the minimum initial health needed?
1. Math.max(1, x)
2. Math.max(1, -x)
3. Math.max(1, 1 - x)
4. Math.max(1, x + 1)

Q7: When computing dfs(i,j), if both rightHealth and downHealth equal 10, and dungeon[i][j] = -3, what is currentMinHealth?
1. 7
2. 10
3. 13
4. 14
