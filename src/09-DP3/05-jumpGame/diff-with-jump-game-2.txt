1. **Problem Objectives**:
   - **Jump Game I** (Problem 55):
     - Goal: Determine if you can reach the last index
     - Returns: boolean (true/false)
     - Question: "Can I reach the end?"

   - **Jump Game II** (Problem 45):
     - Goal: Find the minimum number of jumps to reach the last index
     - Returns: number (minimum jumps)
     - Question: "What's the shortest path to the end?"
     - Guarantees that you can always reach the end

2. **Key Constraints**:
   - **Jump Game I**:
     - Array length: 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^4
     - Jump values: 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^5
     - May be impossible to reach the end (can return false)

   - **Jump Game II**:
     - Array length: 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^4
     - Jump values: 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 1000
     - Guarantees that reaching the end is always possible
     - Must find optimal (minimum) number of jumps

3. **Solution Approach Differences**:
   - **Jump Game I**:
     - Uses DFS to find ANY valid path to the end
     - Can stop as soon as any valid path is found
     - Handles the case of being stuck (nums[i] = 0)
     - Memoizes boolean results (can/cannot reach from position)

   - **Jump Game II**:
     - Uses DFS to find the SHORTEST path to the end
     - Must explore all possible paths to find minimum
     - Memoizes numerical results (minimum jumps from position)
     - Initializes with Infinity and finds minimum

4. **Example Illustration**:
   For array `[2,3,1,1,4]`:
   - **Jump Game I** asks: "Can I reach index 4?" → true
   - **Jump Game II** asks: "What's the minimum jumps to reach index 4?" → 2 jumps

5. **Base Cases**:
   - **Jump Game I**:
     ```javascript
     if (position >= target) {
         return true;
     }
     ```
   - **Jump Game II**:
     ```javascript
     if (i >= n - 1) {
         return 0;  // 0 additional jumps needed
     }
     ```

The fundamental difference is that Jump Game I is a reachability problem 
(existence of a path), 
while Jump Game II is an optimization problem (finding the shortest path). 
This leads to different return types, different base cases, 
and different ways of handling the recursion and memoization.
