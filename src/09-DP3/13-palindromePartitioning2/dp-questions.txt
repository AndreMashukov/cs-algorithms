Problem: Palindrome Partitioning II (Dynamic Programming)

Q1: What is the purpose of the isPalin[i][j] table in the DP solution?
1. To store the minimum cuts for each substring
2. To precompute which substrings are palindromes for O(1) lookup
3. To track the optimal partition points
4. To count the number of palindromes in the string

Q2: How do we fill the isPalin table for palindromes of length 3 and more?
1. Check if first and last characters match and inner substring is palindrome
2. Compare all characters one by one
3. Use recursion to check smaller palindromes
4. Apply the KMP algorithm for pattern matching

Q3: What does dp[i] represent in the DP array?
1. Whether s[0:i+1] is a palindrome
2. The number of palindromes ending at position i
3. The minimum cuts needed to partition s[0:i+1]
4. The length of longest palindrome ending at i

Q4: In the DP transition, when is dp[i] set to 0?
1. When position i is the start of string
2. When s[0:i+1] is already a complete palindrome
3. When we can't find any valid cuts
4. When i equals the string length

Q5: In the inner loop where we try cuts at position j, what condition must be satisfied?
1. j must be greater than i
2. s[j+1:i+1] must be a palindrome
3. dp[j] must be minimum so far
4. j must be a multiple of 2

Q6: What's the time complexity advantage of precomputing the palindrome table?
1. Reduces overall complexity from O(n³) to O(n²)
2. Eliminates the need for memoization
3. Makes palindrome checks O(1) instead of O(n)
4. Allows for parallel processing of subproblems

Q7: For the transition dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1), why do we add 1 to dp[j]?
1. To account for the palindrome at position j
2. To represent the cut made after position j
3. To handle 1-indexed array positions
4. To ensure minimum value is always positive
