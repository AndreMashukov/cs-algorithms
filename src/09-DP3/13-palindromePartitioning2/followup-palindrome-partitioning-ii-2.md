Based on the errors in your solution, the fundamental concept that seems to be misunderstood is how to correctly translate **substring properties (like length) into the correct loop boundaries and array indices** for a dynamic programming table.

Let's focus on the `isPali` precomputation to clarify this.

***

### Conceptual Probe

**Question 1:** The goal of the `isPali` table is to answer the question: "Is the substring from index `i` to `j` a palindrome?". Your code uses a variable `len` to iterate through substring lengths. What is the direct mathematical relationship between a starting index `i`, an ending index `j`, and the substring's length `len`?

**Question 2:** In your final loop, you have the line `isPali[i][i + len] = true`. If `i=0` and `len=3`, this sets `isPali[0][3]`. For a string of length 3 like `s = "aba"`, what substring does `isPali[0][3]` correspond to? Does this match the substring of length 3 that you intended to check?

***

### "What If" Scenario

That makes sense. Now that we've reviewed the relationship between length and indices, let's trace a scenario where your current code fails.

Consider the string `s = "aab"` (where `n=3`). The correct `isPali` table should show that `isPali[0][1]` is `true` ("aa") and all other substrings of length > 1 are false.

Could you trace how your precomputation loop for `len = 3` would execute for this string? 

```javascript
for (let len = 3; len <= n; len++) {
  for (let i = 0; i < n - len; i++) { // What is the upper bound for i here when n=3 and len=3?
    // ... does this inner code ever run?
  }
}
```

What would the final state of your `isPali` table be, and why would it be missing information that the `dfs` function needs?
