Problem: Palindrome Partitioning II (DFS with Memoization)

Q1: 1
The 'start' parameter indicates the starting index of the current substring we're trying to partition.

Q2: 2
We only consider substrings that are palindromes as valid pieces for partitioning.

Q3: 3
We add 1 when we need to make a cut to separate the current palindrome from the remaining string.

Q4: 2
Base case occurs when start >= n, meaning we've successfully processed the entire string.

Q5: 2
Memoization stores the minimum cuts needed for each starting position to avoid recomputation.

Q6: 1
When end=1, we get palindrome "aa" and recursively solve for remaining substring "b" starting at position 2.

Q7: 2
memo[1] stores the minimum cuts needed to partition the substring starting from index 1 to the end.
