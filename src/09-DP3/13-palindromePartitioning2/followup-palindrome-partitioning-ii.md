Based on the errors in your solution, the fundamental concept that seems to be misunderstood is how to correctly manage **indices and loop boundaries** when building a dynamic programming table based on substring length.

Your recursive `dfs` function is logically correct, but it relies on an `isPali` table that is not being filled properly. Let's focus on that.

### Conceptual Probe

**Question 1:** When you are checking for palindromes of a specific `length`, and your substring starts at index `i`, what is the correct formula to calculate the substring's ending index, `j`?

**Question 2:** To check if the substring `s[i...j]` is a palindrome, you need to check two things: 
1. The outer characters `s[i]` and `s[j]` must match.
2. The *inner* substring must also be a palindrome.

What are the start and end indices of that inner substring?

### "What If" Scenario

That makes sense. Now that we've reviewed the indexing, let's apply it to a scenario where your current code would fail.

Consider the simple string `s = "aba"`.

The correct `isPali` table should indicate that `isPali[0][2]` is `true`.

Could you trace how your current precomputation loop for `len = 3` would execute for this string? 

```javascript
for (let len = 3; len <= n; len++) {
  for (let i = 0; i < n - len; i++) { // What happens here?
    // ...
    if (s[i] === s[i + len] && ...) { // And what happens here?
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

What would the final state of your `isPali` table be, and why would it be incorrect?
