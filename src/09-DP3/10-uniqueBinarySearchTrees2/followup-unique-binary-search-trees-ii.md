Based on the errors in your solution, the fundamental concept that seems to be missing is how the range of numbers is partitioned to maintain the Binary Search Tree (BST) property during recursion. Your code also has a common variable-naming bug that prevents the tree from being built correctly.

Let's clarify this with a couple of questions.

### Conceptual Probe

**Question 1:** In any valid Binary Search Tree, if you have a node with value `X`, what must be true about all the values in its left subtree? And what must be true about all the values in its right subtree?

**Question 2:** In your code, you have the recursive call `left = dfs(start + 1, root)`. If your current range is `[1, 5]` and you pick `3` as the root, this call becomes `dfs(2, 3)`. Does the range `[2, 3]` correctly represent all the numbers that should go into the left subtree of root `3`? Why or why not?

### "What If" Scenario

That makes sense. Now that we've reviewed the core BST property, let's apply it to a concrete scenario.

Imagine you are writing the same `generateTrees` function. You are currently processing the range of numbers `[10, 20]` and you have chosen `15` as the root node.

What would be the **exact parameters** for the two recursive `dfs` calls you would make to generate all possible left and right subtrees for the root `15`?
