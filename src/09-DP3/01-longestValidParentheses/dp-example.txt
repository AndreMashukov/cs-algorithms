I'll explain how this dynamic programming algorithm works using a simple example: `"()(())"`.

Let's go through it step by step:

1. First, we create a DP array of the same length as the input string, initialized with zeros:
```
String: ( ) ( ( ) )
Index:  0 1 2 3 4 5
DP:     0 0 0 0 0 0
```

2. We iterate through the string starting from index 1, 
and we only do something when we encounter a closing parenthesis `)`. 
For each `)`, we have two cases:

Case 1: When current `)` matches with an immediate preceding `(`
Case 2: When current `)` matches with an earlier `(` beyond the immediate previous position

Let's see how the DP array gets filled:

```
String: ( ) ( ( ) )
Index:  0 1 2 3 4 5
```

Step 1 (i=1): Looking at ')'
- Previous char is '(' (Case 1)
- dp[1] = 2 (forms valid "()")
```
DP: 0 2 0 0 0 0
```

Step 2 (i=4): Looking at ')'
- Previous char is '(' (Case 1)
- dp[4] = 2 (forms valid "()")
```
DP: 0 2 0 0 2 0
```

Step 3 (i=5): Looking at ')'
- Previous char is ')' (Case 2)
- We look back dp[4]=2 positions from i=5
   dp[i - 1] = dp[4] = 2
- Check if char at (5-2-1=2) is '('
  s[i - dp[i - 1] - 1] = s[2] = "("
- Yes, it is! So we combine:
  * dp[4] (=2) for the inner "()" >> dp[i - 1] 
  * 2 for the outer pair >> dp[i - dp[i - 1] - 2] 
  * dp[1] (=2) for any valid sequence before >> XX
- dp[5] = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
```
DP: 0 2 0 0 2 6
```

Final DP array: `[0,2,0,0,2,6]`

The maximum value in the DP array is 6, which corresponds to the entire string "()(())" being valid.

To break down what the 6 represents:
- The outer valid pair: "(....)"
- The nested valid pair: "(())"
- The separate valid pair at the start: "()"
All together making "()(())" with length 6.

This is why dynamic programming is powerful here - i
it builds up the solution by keeping track of previous 
valid subsequences and combining 
them when possible to find longer valid sequences.
