Problem: Longest Valid Parentheses (Brute force approach)

Q1: In the `isValid` helper function, what is the primary purpose of the `balance` variable?
1. To count the total number of parentheses in the substring.
2. To ensure that for every opening parenthesis there is a corresponding closing parenthesis appearing later, and that closing parentheses do not appear before an unmatched opening one.
3. To count the number of valid pairs found.
4. To track the depth of nested parentheses.

Q2: The main `longestValidParentheses_dfs` function iterates with two nested loops (i and j). What do these loops define in the context of the problem?
1. They define the start and end of recursive calls for a DFS traversal.
2. They systematically generate all possible substrings of the input string `s`.
3. They are used to build a graph representation of the parentheses string.
4. They implement a stack-based validation for each character.

Q3: If the `isValid` function encounters `balance < 0` at any point while checking a substring, what does this signify?
1. The substring is likely valid but needs further checking.
2. A closing parenthesis has appeared without a preceding unmatched opening parenthesis.
3. An opening parenthesis has appeared without a succeeding closing parenthesis.
4. The substring has an equal number of opening and closing parentheses.

Q4: How is the `maxLength` variable updated in the `longestValidParentheses_dfs` function?
1. It is incremented each time a `(` is found.
2. It is updated only at the very end of the function, after all substrings are checked.
3. It is updated whenever a substring `sub` is determined to be valid by `isValid(sub)`, by comparing `sub.length` with the current `maxLength`.
4. It is set to the length of the first valid substring found.

Q5: What is the role of `s.substring(i, j + 1)`?
1. It creates a copy of the original string `s` for modification.
2. It extracts a portion of the string `s` starting from index `i` up to, but not including, index `j+1`.
3. It validates the substring between `i` and `j`.
4. It splits the string `s` into two parts at index `i`.

Q6: In the provided `longestValidParentheses_dfs` code, the `findLongest` recursive function is defined but not explicitly called within the main loops. Why might this be the case for this particular implementation strategy?
1. The `findLongest` function is intended for a different, more complex version of DFS not fully implemented here.
2. The generation and checking of all substrings via nested loops itself constitutes the "exploration" process, making explicit recursive calls for substring generation redundant in this specific brute-force approach.
3. The `findLongest` function is called implicitly by the JavaScript runtime.
4. It was meant to be used with the `isValid` function directly.

Q7: If `s = "()(()"`, which of the following substrings will be passed to `isValid` and result in `maxLength` being updated (assume `maxLength` starts at 0)?
1. "(", ")", "(", "(", ")"
2. "()" (from index 0), and then again "()" (from index 2)
3. "()(()"
4. Only "(()"
