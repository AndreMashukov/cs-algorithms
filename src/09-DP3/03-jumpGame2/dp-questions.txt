Problem: Jump Game II (DP approach)

Q1: What does `dp[i]` represent in the `jumpGameII_dp` function?
1. The maximum jump length from index i.
2. Whether index i is reachable or not.
3. The minimum number of jumps to reach index i from the starting position.
4. The farthest index reachable from index i.

Q2: Why is `dp[0]` initialized to 0?
1. Because the first element is always 0.
2. To prevent array out-of-bounds errors.
3. Because no jumps are needed to reach the starting position (we're already there).
4. Because we can't jump from the starting position.

Q3: In the nested loops, what does the condition `if (dp[i] === Infinity) continue;` accomplish?
1. It handles the case when nums[i] is 0.
2. It optimizes memory usage.
3. It prevents infinite loops.
4. It skips positions that are unreachable from the starting position.

Q4: What does the line `dp[nextIndex] = Math.min(dp[nextIndex], dp[i] + 1)` accomplish?
1. It calculates the average jumps needed.
2. It counts the total number of ways to reach nextIndex.
3. It updates dp[nextIndex] with the minimum jumps needed: either the current value or dp[i] + 1 
  (one more jump from position i).
4. It finds the maximum jumps to reach nextIndex.

Q5: Why do we iterate `for (let jump = 1; jump <= nums[i]; jump++)` instead of just considering the maximum jump?
1. To validate that all jumps are legal.
2. To calculate the sum of all possible jumps.
3. Because sometimes a shorter jump leads to a better overall path with fewer total jumps.
4. To find all possible paths, not just the longest jump.

Q6: If `nums = [2,3,1,1,4]`, what will be the final values in the `dp` array?
1. [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
2. [0, 2, 3, 1, 4]
3. [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
4. [0, Infinity, Infinity, Infinity, Infinity]

Q7: What is the time complexity of this DP approach?
1. O(n log n) due to the sorting involved.
2. O(1) constant time.
3. O(nÂ²) because for each position i, we might check up to n positions that can be reached.
4. O(n) where n is the length of nums.
