Problem: Jump Game II (DFS with Memoization)

Q1: In the `dfs(i)` function, what does the parameter `i` represent?
1. The number of jumps taken so far.
2. The current index/position in the nums array.
3. The maximum jump length from the current position.
4. The target index we're trying to reach.

Q2: What is the base case in the `dfs(i)` function?
1. When `i === 0` (reached the starting position).
2. When `i >= n - 1` (reached or passed the last index).
3. When `nums[i] === 0` (can't jump further).
4. When the memoization table is full.

Q3: In the inner loop `for (let jump = 1; jump <= nums[i]; jump++)`, what does this loop accomplish?
1. It finds the maximum possible jump from position i.
2. It explores all possible jump lengths from position i (from 1 to nums[i] steps).
3. It calculates the sum of all possible jumps.
4. It validates whether each jump is legal.

Q4: How does memoization improve the efficiency of the DFS solution?
1. It reduces the space complexity to O(1).
2. It stores previously computed results for each index to avoid redundant calculations.
3. It sorts the results for faster lookup.
4. It changes the algorithm from DFS to BFS.

Q5: What does `minJumps = Math.min(minJumps, 1 + jumpsFromNext)` calculate?
1. The maximum jumps among all possible paths.
2. The minimum jumps needed: 1 (current jump) plus minimum jumps from the next position.
3. The average number of jumps across all paths.
4. The total number of possible paths.

Q6: If `nums = [2,3,1,1,4]` and we call `dfs(0)`, which positions will be explored in the first recursive call?
1. Only position 1 (since nums[0] = 2, we can jump 1 or 2 steps).
2. Positions 1 and 2 (since nums[0] = 2, we can jump 1 or 2 steps).
3. Positions 0, 1, and 2.
4. All positions in the array.

Q7: Why do we initialize `minJumps = Infinity` at the beginning of the `dfs(i)` function?
1. To handle the case when nums[i] is 0.
2. To ensure we find the true minimum by starting with a value larger than any possible result.
3. To prevent integer overflow.
4. To mark invalid positions.
