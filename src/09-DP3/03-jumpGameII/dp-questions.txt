Problem: Jump Game II (DP approach)

Q1: What does `dp[i]` represent in the `jumpGameII_dp` function?
1. The maximum jump length from index i.
2. The minimum number of jumps to reach index i from the starting position.
3. Whether index i is reachable or not.
4. The farthest index reachable from index i.

Q2: Why is `dp[0]` initialized to 0?
1. Because we can't jump from the starting position.
2. Because no jumps are needed to reach the starting position (we're already there).
3. Because the first element is always 0.
4. To prevent array out-of-bounds errors.

Q3: In the nested loops, what does the condition `if (dp[i] === Infinity) continue;` accomplish?
1. It prevents infinite loops.
2. It skips positions that are unreachable from the starting position.
3. It handles the case when nums[i] is 0.
4. It optimizes memory usage.

Q4: What does the line `dp[nextIndex] = Math.min(dp[nextIndex], dp[i] + 1)` accomplish?
1. It finds the maximum jumps to reach nextIndex.
2. It updates dp[nextIndex] with the minimum jumps needed: either the current value or dp[i] + 1 (one more jump from position i).
3. It calculates the average jumps needed.
4. It counts the total number of ways to reach nextIndex.

Q5: Why do we iterate `for (let jump = 1; jump <= nums[i]; jump++)` instead of just considering the maximum jump?
1. To find all possible paths, not just the longest jump.
2. Because sometimes a shorter jump leads to a better overall path with fewer total jumps.
3. To validate that all jumps are legal.
4. To calculate the sum of all possible jumps.

Q6: If `nums = [2,3,1,1,4]`, what will be the final values in the `dp` array?
1. [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
2. [0, 2, 3, 1, 4]
3. [0, Infinity, Infinity, Infinity, Infinity]
4. [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]

Q7: What is the time complexity of this DP approach?
1. O(n) where n is the length of nums.
2. O(nÂ²) because for each position i, we might check up to n positions that can be reached.
3. O(n log n) due to the sorting involved.
4. O(1) constant time.
