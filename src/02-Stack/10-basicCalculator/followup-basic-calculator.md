# Basic Calculator - Socratic Follow-Up

## Conceptual Probe

Based on the error in your logic in `mistakes.md`, the core misunderstanding is in the closing parenthesis handling. You're missing the crucial step of adding the current number with sign before popping from the stack.

### Socratic Questions:

**Question 1:** Look at your closing parenthesis handling:
```javascript
sign = st.pop();
res = st.pop();
```
What important operation is missing before these two lines that would incorporate the current number being processed?

**Question 2:** When you encounter a closing parenthesis, what should happen to the current `num` value that might have been accumulated inside the parentheses?

**Question 3:** In the correct sequence, what should be the order of operations when handling ')'? Should you:
1. Pop sign and previous result, then add current number
2. Add current number to result, then pop and apply sign and previous result  
3. Reset everything and start over
4. Something else?

## "What If" Scenario

Let's test with a concrete example: `"(1+2)"`

Walk me through what should happen step by step:
1. When you encounter '(', what values get pushed onto the stack and what gets reset?
2. How do you process "1+2" inside the parentheses?
3. When you encounter ')', what specific operations should occur in what order?
4. What should the final result be?

Now try with a more complex example: `"3+(1+2)"` - show me the complete step-by-step execution with stack operations.
