# Exclusive Time of Functions - Questions

### Problem: Exclusive Time of Functions (Stack)

**Q1: What is the primary role of the stack in the `exclusiveTime` algorithm?**
1. To store the final calculated exclusive times for each function before returning the result.
2. To keep track of the chain of active function calls, with the top of the stack representing the currently running function.
3. To store the timestamps of when each function starts, allowing for quick duration calculations.
4. To queue up the logs in chronological order before processing them sequentially.

**Q2: In the `exclusiveTime` algorithm, why is `prevTime` updated to `fnTime` when a function starts, but to `fnTime + 1` when a function ends?**
1. This is done to account for the time taken by the CPU to switch context between different functions.
2. The update to `fnTime` aligns with the start of a new time unit, while `fnTime + 1` marks the beginning of the next available time unit after the function concludes.
3. It corrects for potential off-by-one errors that arise from using zero-based indexing for timestamps in the logs.
4. This approach simplifies the calculation by ensuring `prevTime` is always an even number, which speeds up processing.

**Q3: Given `n = 1` and `logs = ["0:start:0", "0:end:2"]`, what is the calculated exclusive time for function 0?**
1. 2, because the duration is simply the end timestamp minus the start timestamp (2 - 0).
2. 1, because the function only runs at timestamps 0 and 1, not including the end time.
3. 3, because the function runs during timestamps 0, 1, and 2, which is a total of three time units.
4. 0, because the function starts and ends without any other functions interrupting its execution.

**Q4: How does the algorithm handle a scenario where a function is called recursively, such as `["0:start:0", "0:start:2", "0:end:3", "0:end:5"]`?**
1. The algorithm correctly calculates the total time by treating each call as a separate entity, pausing the outer call and resuming it after the inner call completes.
2. The algorithm would produce an incorrect result because it cannot distinguish between different calls to the same function ID.
3. A stack overflow error would occur because pushing the same function ID twice onto the stack is an invalid state.
4. The inner function call would overwrite the start time of the outer call, leading to a miscalculation of the total duration.

**Q5: What is the time complexity of the `exclusiveTime` algorithm, where L is the number of logs and N is the number of functions?**
1. O(L + N), because the algorithm iterates through all logs once and initializes an array of size N.
2. O(L * N), because for each log, the algorithm might need to search the stack for a function ID.
3. O(L log L), because the logs must be sorted by timestamp before they can be processed correctly.
4. O(N), because the primary determinant of complexity is the number of functions being tracked.

**Q6: What is the purpose of the `if (st.length)` check before calculating the time for a paused function during a `start` event?**
1. It prevents an error if the first log in the list is a `start` event, as there would be no function on the stack to attribute time to.
2. It handles the case where multiple functions start at the exact same timestamp, ensuring they are processed correctly.
3. It checks if the stack has exceeded its memory capacity before pushing a new function call onto it.
4. It verifies that the function ID from the log is valid and within the range of `0` to `n-1`.

**Q7: Why is the exclusive time for a function that is ending calculated as `fnTime - prevTime + 1`?**
1. The `+1` is added to include the time unit when the previously running function was paused.
2. This formula correctly accounts for the inclusive nature of the time interval, including both the start and end timestamps.
3. The `+1` compensates for the time delay introduced by parsing the log string into its components.
4. This calculation is used to round the final execution time up to the nearest whole number.

**Q8: What would be the result if the input `logs` array is empty?**
1. The function would throw an error because it cannot process an empty list of logs.
2. The function would enter an infinite loop as the termination condition is never met.
3. The function would correctly return an array of zeros, as no functions have run.
4. The function would return `null` or `undefined` to signify that no calculation was performed.
