Based on the error in your logic for Q5, it seems there might be a misunderstanding about why the algorithm uses intermediate states (like 2 and 3) instead of changing cells directly from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 in the first pass. This concept is central to solving the problem in-place.

Here are two questions to explore that idea:

1. Imagine the algorithm is processing the board from top-to-bottom, left-to-right. If you immediately change a dead cell at `(r, c)` to a live `1`, how could that prematurely alter the outcome for the cell at `(r, c + 1)` when its turn comes to be evaluated in the same pass?

2. The rules of the Game of Life are applied to every cell "simultaneously." How does using two separate passes—one for marking with intermediate states and one for finalizing the states—simulate this simultaneous update without requiring a second copy of the board?

That makes sense. I understand now that I should focus on the simultaneous nature of the updates. Can you give me a new, small input for the Game of Life? Let me try to solve it.

Of course. Try to determine the next state for this board:

```
[
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 1],
  [0, 1, 0]
]
```

What would the board look like after one full iteration of the Game of Life rules?
