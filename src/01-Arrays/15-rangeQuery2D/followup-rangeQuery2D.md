Based on the error in my logic in my_solution.js, what fundamental concept of [greedy algorithms/dynamic programming] do you think I'm missing? Please ask me one or two targeted questions to test my understanding of that concept.

Your solution attempts to calculate the sum of a sub-rectangle, but it seems to misunderstand how the pre-computed sums in the `dp` table must be combined. The core misunderstanding appears to be in applying the **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle** for a 2D matrix.

Here are a few questions to probe that concept:

- **Question 1:** When you calculate `sum = bottomRight - above - left`, you are subtracting the `above` and `left` rectangular areas from the `bottomRight` area. Can you visualize the small, top-left rectangle (the one from `(0,0)` to `(r1-1, c1-1)`)? How many times is this specific rectangle's sum removed from the total in that calculation?

- **Question 2:** If that top-left rectangle's sum was indeed removed more than once, what must you do to ensure its value is correctly accounted for in the final sum of your target region?

- **Question 3:** Why can't you simply calculate the sum as `dp[r2+1][c2+1] - dp[r1][c1]`? What parts of the final rectangle would be incorrectly included or excluded with this simpler formula?

> That makes sense. I understand now that I need to add back the area that was subtracted twice. Can you give me a new, small input for the problem? Let me try to solve it.

Of course. Let's test this understanding with a very simple case that makes it easy to see the indices at work.

**New Input:**
- `matrix = [[10]]`
- `query = sumRegion(0, 0, 0, 0)`

First, build the `dp` table for this matrix. Then, walk through the `sumRegion` calculation using the full inclusion-exclusion formula (`bottomRight - above - left + topLeft`). What values do you get for each of the four components?
