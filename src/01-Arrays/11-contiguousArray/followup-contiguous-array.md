# Follow-up: Contiguous Array Mistakes

This document outlines the Socratic follow-up for the mistakes identified in `mistakes.js`.

### Conceptual Probe

Based on the error in the logic in `mistakes.js`, the fundamental concept that seems to be missing is the idea of a **cumulative prefix sum (or count)**. The solution resets the `count` at each step rather than accumulating it, which prevents the core logic from working.

Here are a few targeted questions to test that understanding:

- **Question 1:** In this problem, we are tracking the balance between 0s and 1s. If you have a `count` at index `i`, how should the `count` at index `i+1` relate to the `count` at `i`? Should it be a completely new value based only on `nums[i+1]`, or should it build upon the previous count?

- **Question 2:** The algorithm's goal is to find a subarray where the number of 0s and 1s are equal. If we represent 0s as -1 and 1s as +1, what would the sum of the elements in such a subarray be?

- **Question 3:** The algorithm uses a map to store `(count, index)` pairs. What is the significance of finding the *exact same* cumulative `count` value at two different indices, say `j` and `i`? What does that imply about the subarray between `j` and `i`?

### "What If" Scenario

> That makes sense. I understand now that the `count` needs to be cumulative. Can you give me a new, small input for the contiguous array problem? Let me try to solve it.

Of course. Try to walk through your corrected logic with the following input:

`nums = [0, 0, 1, 1]`

What would be the final `max` length returned for this array?
