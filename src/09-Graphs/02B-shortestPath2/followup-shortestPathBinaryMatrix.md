Based on the errors in `mistakes.js`, the fundamental concept that seems to be misunderstood is how to correctly track path length and handle grid boundaries within a Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Here are a couple of questions to test your understanding:

*   **Question 1:** In a BFS for finding the shortest path, what does the `length` variable you're incrementing after processing each level of the queue actually represent? Is it the number of cells in the path or the number of "steps" between cells?
*   **Question 2:** Why is it critical to check if the starting cell `grid[0][0]` is a wall before starting the search? What would happen if you didn't?

That makes sense. I understand now that I should focus on the farthest reach. Can you give me a new, small input for {current problem} Let me try to solve it.

Of course. Let's test your understanding with a new, small input.

Try to trace your corrected algorithm with the following `grid`:

```
[[0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [1, 0, 0]]
```

What would be the final `length` returned, and what is the shortest path?
