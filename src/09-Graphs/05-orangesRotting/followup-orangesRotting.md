Based on the errors in `orangeRottingMistakes.js`, the fundamental concept that appears to be misunderstood is the correct implementation of a **level-order traversal** in Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is essential for tracking discrete time steps like "minutes."

Here are three targeted questions to test the understanding of that concept:

*   **Question 1:** Your original code processes one level (or "minute") by taking a single item from the queue and then looping based on the queue's remaining size. In a time-based BFS problem, why is it critical to process *all* items that are in the queue at the start of a minute before incrementing the time?
*   **Question 2:** In your `if` condition for checking a neighbor, you checked if it was within the grid's bounds. What crucial check about the *state* of the neighboring orange itself was missing, and why would omitting it lead to incorrect results?
*   **Question 3:** Your final return statement was `return time > 0 ? time : -1`. Consider a grid where a fresh orange is isolated and can never be reached. What would the value of the `fresh` counter be when the queue becomes empty, and how should the final return value account for this "impossible" scenario?

That makes sense. I understand now that I should focus on the farthest reach. Can you give me a new, small input for {current problem} Let me try to solve it.

Of course. Let's use a new input to test your refined understanding of level-by-level processing.

Try to trace the correct algorithm with the following `grid`:

```
[[2, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 2]]
```

What would be the final `time` returned, and why is it important that both initial rotten oranges start rotting their neighbors in the very first minute?
