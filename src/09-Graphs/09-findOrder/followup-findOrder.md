### Conceptual Probe

Based on the errors in `mistakes.js`, the likely conceptual gap is in DFS-based topological sorting: specifically, understanding tri-state visitation for cycle detection (unvisited → visiting → visited), proper propagation of boolean results up the recursion, and when to append a node to the output (postorder). The symptom lines are treating the DFS function reference as a condition (`if (!dfs)`) instead of invoking it on neighbors, and not consistently returning a boolean from `dfs` to signal a detected cycle.

- **Question 1**: In DFS topological sort, why is it important to add a course to the ordering only after all its prerequisites have been fully explored? What can go wrong if you push it before exploring its neighbors?
- **Question 2**: What distinct meanings do the "visiting" (on current path) and "visited" (fully processed) states have, and how do they prevent both false positives and false negatives in cycle detection? How do these map to the `cycle` and `visit` sets in your code?
- **Question 3**: If the recursive `dfs(neighbor)` returns `false` (cycle found) for any neighbor, what must the caller do immediately, and why must that boolean propagate all the way up to the top-level call?

### "What If" Scenario

Try this small input that stresses the need for postorder appends and correct boolean propagation.

- **numCourses**: `4`
- **prerequisites**: `[[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]`

Tasks:
- **A.** Give one valid order of courses or explain why none exists.
- **B.** While reasoning, track for course `3` the transitions of its state across sets (unvisited → visiting in `cycle` → visited in `visit`). When exactly should `3` be appended to the output, and why?

When you're ready, post your reasoning and resulting order for this input.
