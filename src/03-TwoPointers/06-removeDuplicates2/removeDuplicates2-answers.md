# Answers: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

## Q1: What is the primary purpose of the left pointer (l) in the removeDuplicates2 algorithm?
**Answer: 3**
The left pointer tracks where the next valid element should be placed in the modified array, maintaining the relative order while allowing at most two duplicates.

## Q2: Given the input array [1,1,1,2,2,3], how many times will the inner while loop execute for the first element (1)?
**Answer: 2**
The inner while loop executes once for the first element (comparing positions 0-1 and 1-2), but the count variable tracks 3 total occurrences through the loop iterations.

## Q3: What is the time complexity of the removeDuplicates2 algorithm?
**Answer: 3**
The algorithm has O(n) time complexity since both pointers traverse the array at most once, and each element is processed a constant number of times.

## Q4: Why does the algorithm use Math.min(2, count) when placing elements?
**Answer: 1**
Math.min(2, count) ensures elements appear at most twice while handling cases where count is less than 2, maintaining the problem's constraints efficiently.

## Q5: What would happen if the algorithm didn't include the condition `r < nums.length - 1` in the inner while loop?
**Answer: 2**
Without this boundary check, accessing nums[r + 1] when r is at the last index would cause an index out of bounds error.

## Q6: For the input [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3], what is the final value of the left pointer (l) after execution?
**Answer: 4**
The modified array becomes [0,0,1,1,2,3,3] with length 7, but the left pointer tracks the next position, so it returns 7 indicating 7 elements were placed.

## Q7: What is the space complexity of this algorithm and why?
**Answer: 2**
The algorithm uses O(1) space because it modifies the input array in-place without allocating additional data structures proportional to input size.

## Q8: Which scenario represents the most challenging edge case for this algorithm?
**Answer: 4**
An array with maximum allowed duplicates for each element tests the algorithm's ability to handle the boundary condition of exactly two duplicates per element across the entire array.
