# Problem: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II (Two Pointers)

Q1: What is the primary purpose of the left pointer (l) in the removeDuplicates2 algorithm?
1. To count occurrences of each element
2. To iterate through the entire array
3. To track where the next valid element should be placed
4. To compare adjacent elements for duplicates

Q2: Given the input array [1,1,1,2,2,3], how many times will the inner while loop execute for the first element (1)?
1. 0 times
2. 1 time  
3. 2 times
4. 3 times

Q3: What is the time complexity of the removeDuplicates2 algorithm?
1. O(n log n)
2. O(nÂ²)
3. O(n)
4. O(1)

Q4: Why does the algorithm use Math.min(2, count) when placing elements?
1. To ensure only unique elements are kept
2. To handle arrays with less than 2 elements
3. To allow at most two occurrences of each element
4. To optimize space complexity

Q5: What would happen if the algorithm didn't include the condition `r < nums.length - 1` in the inner while loop?
1. It would cause an infinite loop
2. It would throw an index out of bounds error
3. It would skip the last element
4. It would work correctly without any issues

Q6: For the input [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3], what is the final value of the left pointer (l) after execution?
1. 5
2. 6
3. 7
4. 8

Q7: What is the space complexity of this algorithm and why?
1. O(n) because it creates a new array
2. O(1) because it modifies the array in-place
3. O(log n) due to recursive calls
4. O(n) for the count variable storage

Q8: Which scenario represents the most challenging edge case for this algorithm?
1. Array with all elements appearing exactly twice
2. Array with alternating duplicate patterns
3. Array where one element appears 100 times consecutively
4. Array with maximum allowed duplicates for each element
