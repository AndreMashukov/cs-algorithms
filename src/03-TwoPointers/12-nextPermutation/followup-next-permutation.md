# Follow-up: Next Permutation Algorithm

## Error Analysis
Your solution in `mistakes.js` contains a critical error in the second phase of the algorithm. You're searching for the swap element starting from the beginning of the array (`let j = 0`) instead of from the end, which violates the core principle of finding the next lexicographically larger permutation.

## Conceptual Gap Identified
The fundamental misunderstanding appears to be about **why we need to find the smallest element that is just larger than the pivot**. Your approach would find any element larger than the pivot, but not necessarily the optimal one for the next permutation.

## Socratic Questions

### Question 1: Direction of Search
In the array [1, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] with pivot = 3 (at index 1), your code searches from left to right starting at index 0. But what happens if we pick the first element larger than 3 that we encounter from the left (which would be 5) versus picking the rightmost element larger than 3 in the suffix? How would each choice affect the lexicographical order of the result?

### Question 2: Lexicographical Minimization
After swapping the pivot with some element in the suffix, we reverse the suffix to get the smallest possible arrangement. But if we don't choose the optimal swap element, why does reversing the suffix not guarantee we get the "next" permutation? What could go wrong if we swap with a larger element than necessary?

### Question 3: Algorithm Invariant
The next permutation algorithm maintains this invariant: "We want the lexicographically smallest permutation that is larger than the current one." If we have multiple elements in the suffix that are larger than the pivot, why is choosing the smallest among them crucial to maintaining this invariant?

## What If Scenario
Let's test your refined understanding with a custom example:

**Input:** `[2, 4, 6, 5, 3, 1]`

1. First, identify the pivot element
2. Then, explain which element should be swapped with the pivot and why
3. Finally, show what the array looks like after the swap and reversal

Try to solve this step by step, focusing on why the direction of search for the swap element matters for getting the correct next permutation.

**Expected reasoning process:**
- Pivot identification: Which element breaks the decreasing pattern from right to left?
- Swap element selection: Among all elements larger than pivot in the suffix, which one should we choose and why?
- Final result: What should the next permutation be?
