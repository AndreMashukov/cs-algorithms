# Next Permutation Algorithm Questions

## Problem: Next Permutation (Two Pointers)

**Q1:** What is the first step in finding the next permutation of an array?
1. Reverse the entire array to get the lexicographically next arrangement
2. Find the rightmost character that is smaller than the character next to it (pivot)
3. Sort the array in ascending order to find the next permutation
4. Find the largest element in the array and move it to the front

**Q2:** In the array [1, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], what is the pivot element that needs to be swapped?
1. The element 5 at index 2, as it's the first decreasing element from right
2. The element 1 at index 0, as it's the smallest element in the array
3. The element 4 at index 3, as it's in the middle of the decreasing sequence
4. The element 3 at index 1, as it's the first element smaller than its successor

**Q3:** After finding the pivot, what element should be swapped with it in [1, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]?
1. The element 5, as it's the largest element in the decreasing suffix
2. The element 1, as it's the smallest element that can create valid permutation
3. The element 2, as it's the smallest element greater than pivot in suffix
4. The element 4, as it's the smallest element greater than pivot in suffix

**Q4:** Why do we reverse the suffix after swapping the pivot in the next permutation algorithm?
1. To ensure the suffix is in ascending order for the lexicographically smallest arrangement
2. To maintain the original order of elements that were not part of the swap
3. To create the largest possible permutation from the remaining elements after swap
4. To optimize the algorithm's time complexity by avoiding additional sorting operations

**Q5:** What happens when the input array is [3, 2, 1] (completely decreasing order)?
1. The algorithm returns [1, 2, 3] by reversing the entire array
2. The algorithm swaps the first and last elements to get [1, 2, 3]
3. The algorithm finds no pivot and sorts the array to get [1, 2, 3]
4. The algorithm treats it as an edge case and returns the original array

**Q6:** In the worst-case scenario, what is the time complexity of the next permutation algorithm?
1. O(n log n) due to the sorting operation required for finding the next element
2. O(nÂ²) because of nested loops used in finding pivot and swap positions
3. O(n) as each element is visited at most twice during the algorithm execution
4. O(1) since the algorithm only performs constant number of swaps and comparisons

**Q7:** What is the space complexity of the next permutation algorithm as implemented?
1. O(n) due to the temporary arrays created during the reversal process
2. O(log n) because of the recursive calls made during the sorting phase
3. O(1) as the algorithm modifies the array in-place without extra storage
4. O(n log n) due to the space required for the sorting algorithm implementation

**Q8:** For the array [1, 2, 3], what will be the result after applying the next permutation algorithm?
1. [1, 3, 2] by swapping elements 2 and 3 and reversing the suffix
2. [2, 1, 3] by moving the first element to create the next arrangement
3. [3, 2, 1] by reversing the array to get the lexicographically next permutation
4. [2, 3, 1] by rotating all elements one position to the right
