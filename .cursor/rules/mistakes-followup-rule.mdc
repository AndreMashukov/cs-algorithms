# Rule: Algorithm Solution Mistake - Socratic Follow-Up

## When to Trigger
- After an attempt to reproduce a solution to an algorithm problem (e.g., greedy, dynamic programming) results in errors or incorrect logic.

## Steps

### Step 3: Conceptual Probe
- Prompt the AI to diagnose the root of the misunderstanding.
- Use this prompt:
  > Based on the error in my logic in my_solution.js, what fundamental concept of [greedy algorithms/dynamic programming] do you think I'm missing? Please ask me one or two targeted questions to test my understanding of that concept.

- The AI should:
  - Identify the likely conceptual gap.
  - Ask 1-2 Socratic questions to probe the user's understanding of that concept.

#### Example AI Response
> Your solution shows you're thinking about all possible paths, which is common for DFS. The core misunderstanding seems to be in identifying the greedy choice.
>
> - Question 1: For Jump Game II, at any given position, what is the most important piece of information you need to decide your next jump to guarantee a minimum number of total jumps? Is it the length of the next jump, or the potential reach from that next jump?
> - Question 2: Why is it safe to not explore every possible jump from the current position? What makes the 'farthest' reachable point a "safe" greedy choice?

---

### Step 4: "What If" Scenario
- Prompt the AI to create a new, small problem to test the refined understanding.
- Use this prompt:
  > That makes sense. I understand now that I should focus on the farthest reach. Can you give me a new, small array for "Jump Game II" where a shorter jump from the start actually leads to a better overall path than the longest jump? Let me try to solve it.

- The AI should:
  - Create a small, custom test case that highlights the key concept.
  - Invite the user to solve it, reinforcing the corrected understanding.

## Enforcement
- Always follow up a failed solution attempt with these two steps before moving on to new problems or explanations.
- For each follow-up, create a separate markdown file documenting the Socratic dialogue and the "what if" scenario. Name the file using the convention: `followup-[problem-name].md` (e.g., `followup-jump-game-ii.md`).
