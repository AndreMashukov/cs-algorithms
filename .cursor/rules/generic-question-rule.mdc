# Generic Feature Q&A Generation Rule

## Format Requirements
1. Each feature should have 6-8 multiple-choice questions
2. Questions should be numbered (Q1, Q2, etc.)
3. Each question must have exactly 4 answer options, numbered 1-4
4. Questions should test comprehensive understanding of feature implementation, not just surface knowledge
5. Include a mix of question types:
   - Core functionality and purpose
   - Implementation details and mechanics
   - Design decisions and trade-offs
   - Integration and dependencies

## Content Guidelines
1. Questions should progress from basic concepts to advanced implementation details
2. Include at least one question about the feature's primary purpose or problem it solves
3. Include at least one question about specific implementation mechanics
4. Include at least one question about design decisions or architectural choices
7. Avoid vague or generic options like "It's broken", "It's standard practice", "For better performance", "To follow conventions", etc.
8. Focus on specific, technical understanding rather than memorization
9. **Answer Distribution**: When creating questions, consciously vary which option (1, 2, 3, or 4) is correct to ensure balanced distribution across all answer choices
10. **Equal Option Length**: All four answer options should have approximately equal text length and detail level. Avoid making the correct answer obviously longer/more comprehensive or having one option be noticeably shorter than others, as this creates bias where longer, more detailed options appear more credible

## Answer Format
1. Create a separate answer file with the same name pattern
2. For each question, provide:
   - The correct answer number
   - A brief explanation (1-2 sentences) justifying why this answer is correct
3. Explanations should highlight the key technical insight or reasoning
4. **Answer Distribution**: Ensure correct answers are evenly distributed across all four options (1, 2, 3, 4). For 6-8 questions, aim for roughly 1-2 questions per option to prevent clustering where certain options (like option 2) appear too frequently while others (like option 4) never appear as correct answers

## Example Structure
```
Feature: [Feature Name] ([Technology/Framework])

Q1: [Question about core purpose/problem solved]
1. [Specific option 1]
2. [Specific option 2]
3. [Specific option 3]
4. [Specific option 4]

Q2: [Question about implementation mechanics]
...

Q6: [Question about performance/trade-offs]
...

Answers:
Q1: [Correct option number]
[Technical explanation of why this is correct]
```

## Question Categories by Feature Type

### For UI Features
- User interaction flow
- State management
- Rendering logic
- Event handling
- Accessibility considerations

### For Backend Features
- Data processing logic
- API design decisions
- Database interactions
- Security considerations
- Scalability patterns

### For System Features
- Architecture patterns
- Configuration management
- Monitoring and logging
- Resource management
- Integration points

This rule ensures comprehensive understanding testing for any feature implementation across different domains

## Additional Rules: Answers and Markdown Format

- When generating answers for any set of questions, always include the corresponding question text itself directly above each answer and explanation.
- All generated files for questions and answers must use valid Markdown format with appropriate headings, lists, and code blocks as needed.
