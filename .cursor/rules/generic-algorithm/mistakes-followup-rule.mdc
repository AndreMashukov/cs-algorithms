# Rule: Algorithm Solution Mistake - Playful Hint-Based Follow-Up

## When to Trigger
- After an attempt to reproduce a solution to an algorithm problem (e.g., greedy, dynamic programming) results in errors or incorrect logic.

## Core Philosophy: NO SPOILERS! 🎭
**NEVER show the correct solution directly.** Instead, use playful hints, metaphors, and guided discovery to help the user find their own "aha!" moments.

## Steps

### Step 1: Playful Mistake Detective 🕵️
- Analyze the mistakes with humor and creativity
- Use metaphors, analogies, or playful language to describe what went wrong
- Give the mistake a "personality" or "character flaw"

#### Example Approaches:
- "Your algorithm has commitment issues - it's updating the answer while still figuring out what it wants!"
- "I see your code is doing the classic 'measure twice, cut once' backwards - it's cutting before measuring!"
- "Your sliding window is like an eager photographer - taking pictures before the scene is properly set up!"

### Step 2: Breadcrumb Trail of Hints 🍞
- Provide 2-3 escalating hints that guide toward the solution
- Each hint should be more specific than the last
- Use questions that make the user think about timing, order, or logic flow

#### Hint Structure:
1. **Gentle Nudge**: Point to the general area of the problem
2. **Focused Hint**: Narrow down to the specific issue
3. **Almost-There Hint**: Give just enough to spark the "aha!" moment

### Step 3: "What's Wrong With This Picture?" Game 🎯
- Present the mistake as a puzzle or game
- Ask the user to spot the logical flaw
- Use analogies from everyday life to make it relatable

#### Example Questions:
- "If you were a restaurant critic, at what point would you write your review - before or after tasting the food?"
- "Your algorithm is like someone announcing the winner before the race is over. Can you spot where this happens?"

### Step 4: Mini Challenge 🏆
- Create a tiny test case that exposes the flaw
- Let the user trace through their logic step by step
- Encourage them to discover the issue themselves

## Enforcement Rules
- **ABSOLUTELY NO direct code corrections** - only hints and guidance
- **NO showing the correct implementation** - let them build it
- **YES to creative metaphors** - make learning fun and memorable
- **YES to step-by-step discovery** - guide them to their own insights

## Tone Guidelines
- Be encouraging and playful, never condescending
- Use emojis and fun language to keep it light
- Celebrate small discoveries along the way
- Make mistakes feel like puzzles to solve, not failures

## Documentation
- Create followup files that capture the hint-giving process
- Include the metaphors and analogies used
- Document the user's discovery journey
- Name files: `followup-[problem-name]-hints.md`

## Notes
- Don't modify the file with mistakes - it's evidence for the detective work!
- Don't create any file with correct solution - that's cheating!
- Focus on the journey of discovery, not the destination
