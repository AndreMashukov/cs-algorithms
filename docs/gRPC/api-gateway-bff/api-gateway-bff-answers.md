# API Gateway, gRPC-Web, and BFF Architecture - Answers

## Answer Key with Explanations

---

**Q1:** What is the primary role of an API Gateway in a gRPC-based architecture?

**Answer: 2**

The API Gateway acts as a centralized entry point handling protocol translation between gRPC-Web and native gRPC, routing requests to appropriate backend services, enforcing security policies, and managing cross-cutting concerns like rate limiting and observability.

---

**Q2:** Why can't React applications communicate directly with gRPC services without an intermediary?

**Answer: 3**

Browsers have fundamental limitations that prevent direct gRPC communication, including lack of HTTP/2 server push support, inability to handle raw binary Protocol Buffer data efficiently, and CORS restrictions that native gRPC doesn't address.

---

**Q3:** What is the primary purpose of the Backend for Frontend (BFF) pattern in microservices architecture?

**Answer: 1**

The BFF pattern creates dedicated backend services for different client types (web, mobile, desktop), allowing each to provide client-specific data aggregation, business logic, and optimizations without impacting other client types.

---

**Q4:** How does the API Gateway perform protocol translation between gRPC-Web and native gRPC?

**Answer: 3**

The API Gateway (typically Envoy Proxy) translates HTTP/1.1 gRPC-Web requests to HTTP/2 native gRPC while preserving the original protobuf payload and adding the necessary gRPC-specific headers for backend communication.

---

**Q5:** What are the essential components of an Envoy Proxy configuration for supporting gRPC-Web clients?

**Answer: 2**

Essential Envoy components include the gRPC-Web filter for protocol translation, CORS filter for browser compatibility, HTTP routing filter for request direction, and cluster configuration for backend service discovery and load balancing.

---

**Q6:** What happens when a React component makes a gRPC-Web call through the API Gateway architecture?

**Answer: 3**

The gRPC-Web client creates a protobuf request, wraps it in HTTP/1.1 format, sends it to the API Gateway which performs protocol translation and forwards it to the appropriate BFF service as native gRPC.

---

**Q7:** What specific optimizations does a Web BFF provide compared to direct microservice access?

**Answer: 2**

Web BFF provides data aggregation from multiple microservices in single calls, web-specific feature enrichment (like collaboration tokens), intelligent caching strategies, and UI-optimized response formatting with rich metadata.

---

**Q8:** How does error handling flow through the gRPC-Web → API Gateway → BFF → Microservice chain?

**Answer: 3**

Microservices return standard gRPC status codes, BFF services preserve these codes while adding contextual information, and the API Gateway translates them back to gRPC-Web format for browser consumption.

---

**Q9:** What caching strategies are typically employed across this multi-tier architecture?

**Answer: 2**

The architecture employs multi-level caching including API Gateway response caching for static/semi-static data, BFF-level Redis caching for aggregated responses, and client-side browser caching for appropriate resources.

---

**Q10:** How does the architecture handle real-time collaboration features like document editing?

**Answer: 2**

The Web BFF establishes gRPC streaming connections to clients, coordinating real-time text edits, cursor positions, and user presence information through bidirectional streaming protocols.

---

**Q11:** What are the key architectural differences between Web BFF and Mobile BFF implementations?

**Answer: 2**

Web BFF provides rich metadata and full UI data suitable for desktop experiences, while Mobile BFF offers minimal payloads optimized for battery life, bandwidth constraints, and mobile-specific features like offline synchronization.

---

**Q12:** How is authentication handled across the entire request chain in this architecture?

**Answer: 2**

JWT tokens flow from the React client through the API Gateway to the BFF, where token validation occurs against the Auth Service before the BFF forwards authenticated requests to downstream microservices.

---

**Q13:** What observability and monitoring capabilities are typically built into this architecture?

**Answer: 2**

The architecture includes distributed tracing across all components, metrics collection (Prometheus), access logging, health monitoring, and correlation IDs for tracking requests through the entire system.

---

**Q14:** How does load balancing work for BFF services behind the API Gateway?

**Answer: 2**

The API Gateway implements round-robin or weighted distribution with active health checks, circuit breaking for failed instances, and automatic failover to healthy BFF instances based on probe results.

---

**Q15:** What are the primary security considerations when exposing gRPC services through an API Gateway?

**Answer: 2**

Security is implemented through TLS termination at the gateway, JWT token validation, CORS policy enforcement, protobuf input validation, and service-level access controls across all architectural layers.

---

**Q16:** How is API versioning handled in a gRPC-Web + BFF architecture?

**Answer: 2**

Versioning uses service packages with versioned namespaces (web.bff.v1, web.bff.v2) combined with route-based versioning in the API Gateway to support multiple API versions simultaneously.

---

**Q17:** What are the main performance bottlenecks in this gRPC-Web + BFF architecture?

**Answer: 2**

Primary bottlenecks include API Gateway protocol translation overhead, BFF aggregation latency when calling multiple downstream services, and gRPC-Web HTTP/1.1 limitations compared to native gRPC performance.

---

**Q18:** How should partial failures be handled in BFF aggregation scenarios?

**Answer: 2**

Implement graceful degradation strategies with fallback data, isolated error handling for each downstream service call, and meaningful service status reporting to inform clients of degraded functionality.

---

**Q19:** What deployment considerations are critical for this multi-component architecture?

**Answer: 2**

Critical considerations include coordinating service dependencies, implementing comprehensive health checks, using rolling update strategies, and ensuring proper configuration management across all architectural tiers.

---

**Q20:** How should you test the complete gRPC-Web → API Gateway → BFF → Microservice flow?

**Answer: 2**

Comprehensive testing requires unit tests for individual components, contract testing for API compatibility, integration testing for component interactions, and end-to-end flow validation with realistic user scenarios.
