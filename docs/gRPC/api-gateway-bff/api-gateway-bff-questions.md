# API Gateway, gRPC-Web, and BFF Architecture - Questions

## Multiple Choice Questions on Modern Microservices Communication

---

**Q1:** What is the primary role of an API Gateway in a gRPC-based architecture?

1. To serve as a database connection pool for microservices and manage transaction isolation levels across distributed systems
2. To act as a centralized entry point that handles protocol translation, routing, security, and cross-cutting concerns like rate limiting
3. To compile and optimize Protocol Buffer schemas into efficient binary formats for improved serialization performance
4. To provide a graphical user interface for monitoring microservice health checks and debugging distributed system failures

**Q2:** Why can't React applications communicate directly with gRPC services without an intermediary?

1. React applications lack the computational resources needed to handle the complex mathematical operations required by gRPC encryption algorithms
2. Browser security models prevent React applications from establishing the persistent TCP connections that gRPC services require for optimal performance
3. Browsers don't support HTTP/2 server push, binary Protocol Buffer handling, and CORS requirements that native gRPC communication needs
4. React's virtual DOM architecture is fundamentally incompatible with the streaming data formats used by gRPC for real-time communication

**Q3:** What is the primary purpose of the Backend for Frontend (BFF) pattern in microservices architecture?

1. To create separate backend services optimized for different client types, providing client-specific data aggregation and business logic
2. To implement a backup and failover system that ensures high availability by replicating all microservice functionality across multiple data centers
3. To establish a caching layer that stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce database load and improve response times
4. To provide a unified logging and monitoring system that aggregates metrics from all microservices into a centralized dashboard

**Q4:** How does the API Gateway perform protocol translation between gRPC-Web and native gRPC?

1. It converts the entire request to JSON format, processes it through REST endpoints, then translates back to gRPC for backend communication
2. It strips the HTTP headers completely and forwards only the binary payload, letting each microservice handle its own protocol interpretation
3. It translates HTTP/1.1 gRPC-Web requests to HTTP/2 gRPC while preserving the protobuf payload and adding necessary gRPC headers
4. It establishes persistent WebSocket connections between the browser and backend, tunneling all gRPC communication through the WebSocket protocol

**Q5:** What are the essential components of an Envoy Proxy configuration for supporting gRPC-Web clients?

1. WebSocket proxy filter, JSON transformation filter, database connection filter, and custom authentication filter for token validation
2. gRPC-Web translation filter, CORS handling filter, HTTP routing filter, and cluster configuration for backend service discovery
3. SSL certificate manager, load balancing algorithm selector, health check probe configuration, and traffic splitting rule engine
4. Message compression filter, rate limiting enforcer, circuit breaker implementation, and distributed tracing correlation manager

**Q6:** What happens when a React component makes a gRPC-Web call through the API Gateway architecture?

1. The component directly connects to the database, retrieves data using SQL queries, and formats the results into JavaScript objects
2. React serializes the request to JSON, sends it via XMLHttpRequest, and the API Gateway converts it to gRPC before forwarding
3. The gRPC-Web client creates a protobuf request, wraps it in HTTP/1.1, sends to API Gateway which translates and forwards to BFF
4. The browser establishes a WebSocket connection, streams binary data directly to microservices, bypassing the API Gateway entirely

**Q7:** What specific optimizations does a Web BFF provide compared to direct microservice access?

1. Automatic database query optimization, SQL query caching, and intelligent indexing strategies for improved data retrieval performance
2. Data aggregation from multiple services, web-specific feature enrichment, caching strategies, and UI-optimized response formatting
3. Direct memory access to microservice data structures, bypassing network serialization overhead and reducing computational complexity
4. Automatic code generation for React components, type-safe API bindings, and client-side validation rules for form inputs

**Q8:** How does error handling flow through the gRPC-Web → API Gateway → BFF → Microservice chain?

1. Each component transforms errors into its own format, losing the original context and requiring manual error code mapping at each layer
2. Errors are converted to HTTP status codes at the API Gateway and all subsequent components use only HTTP error semantics
3. Microservices return gRPC status codes, BFFs preserve them with added context, API Gateway translates to gRPC-Web format
4. All errors are logged centrally but not propagated to clients, with each component generating its own generic error responses

**Q9:** What caching strategies are typically employed across this multi-tier architecture?

1. Only database-level caching is used, with all other components directly querying the database for real-time data consistency
2. Multi-level caching including API Gateway response caching, BFF Redis caching, and client-side browser caching strategies
3. Distributed cache replication across all microservices, ensuring every service maintains identical cached data at all times
4. Single centralized cache cluster that all components access, eliminating the need for component-specific caching strategies

**Q10:** How does the architecture handle real-time collaboration features like document editing?

1. All clients poll the API Gateway every 100ms to check for changes, with the gateway maintaining a queue of recent updates
2. Web BFF establishes gRPC streaming connections to clients, coordinating real-time text edits, cursor positions, and user presence
3. Microservices broadcast changes directly to all connected browsers using Server-Sent Events, bypassing the API Gateway completely
4. A separate WebSocket server handles all real-time features independently, while the gRPC architecture serves only static content

**Q11:** What are the key architectural differences between Web BFF and Mobile BFF implementations?

1. Web BFF uses REST APIs while Mobile BFF uses GraphQL, ensuring each client type gets its preferred query language
2. Web BFF provides rich metadata and full UI data while Mobile BFF offers minimal payloads optimized for battery and bandwidth
3. Web BFF runs on powerful servers while Mobile BFF runs on edge computing nodes closer to mobile users for reduced latency
4. Web BFF handles authentication while Mobile BFF delegates all security concerns to external identity providers for simplified integration

**Q12:** How is authentication handled across the entire request chain in this architecture?

1. Each component independently validates credentials using its own authentication database, ensuring distributed security without dependencies
2. JWT tokens flow from React client through API Gateway to BFF, where token validation occurs before forwarding to microservices
3. API Gateway strips all authentication headers and injects service-to-service certificates for backend communication security
4. Authentication occurs only at the microservice level, with all intermediate components acting as transparent proxies

**Q13:** What observability and monitoring capabilities are typically built into this architecture?

1. Simple log file aggregation from each component, with manual analysis required to correlate events across the distributed system
2. Distributed tracing, metrics collection, access logging, and health monitoring spanning from API Gateway through all backend services
3. Only database performance monitoring, since application-level metrics are considered unnecessary overhead in microservice architectures
4. Client-side error reporting only, with backend services operating in a black-box mode to minimize monitoring infrastructure costs

**Q14:** How does load balancing work for BFF services behind the API Gateway?

1. API Gateway randomly selects BFF instances without health checking, relying on service mesh retry policies for failure handling
2. Round-robin distribution with health checks, circuit breaking, and automatic failover to healthy BFF instances based on probe results
3. All requests are forwarded to a single BFF instance to maintain session consistency and avoid distributed state management complexity
4. Load balancing is handled entirely by Kubernetes, with the API Gateway acting as a simple proxy without load balancing logic

**Q15:** What are the primary security considerations when exposing gRPC services through an API Gateway?

1. Only rate limiting is necessary since gRPC's binary format provides inherent security against common web-based attacks
2. TLS termination, JWT validation, CORS enforcement, input validation, and service-level access controls across all architectural layers
3. Database encryption is sufficient, as all network communication security is handled automatically by gRPC's built-in security features
4. Client-side certificate validation only, with all backend services operating in a trusted network without additional security measures

**Q16:** How is API versioning handled in a gRPC-Web + BFF architecture?

1. Version numbers are embedded in protobuf message fields, allowing backward compatibility without changing service endpoints or routing
2. Service packages use versioned namespaces (v1, v2) with route-based versioning for supporting multiple API versions simultaneously
3. All versions use the same endpoints with content negotiation headers determining which version of the API to invoke
4. Versioning is handled entirely at the database schema level, with all API endpoints remaining static regardless of feature changes

**Q17:** What are the main performance bottlenecks in this gRPC-Web + BFF architecture?

1. Database connection limits are always the primary bottleneck, as network and application layers have negligible performance impact
2. API Gateway protocol translation overhead, BFF aggregation latency, and gRPC-Web HTTP/1.1 limitations compared to native gRPC
3. React component rendering is the sole performance bottleneck, as all backend components operate at near-zero latency
4. Only memory usage in microservices matters, since CPU and network resources are unlimited in containerized cloud environments

**Q18:** How should partial failures be handled in BFF aggregation scenarios?

1. Immediately return error responses to clients when any downstream service fails, ensuring consistent error semantics across all operations
2. Implement graceful degradation with fallback data, isolated error handling, and meaningful service status reporting to clients
3. Retry all failed requests indefinitely until success, as eventual consistency guarantees that all operations will eventually complete
4. Cache all responses permanently to eliminate the possibility of service failures affecting client applications in the future

**Q19:** What deployment considerations are critical for this multi-component architecture?

1. Deploy all components simultaneously using blue-green deployment to ensure perfect version synchronization across the entire system
2. Coordinate service dependencies, implement health checks, use rolling updates, and ensure proper configuration management across all tiers
3. Focus only on database migration scripts, as application deployments have no interdependencies and can be deployed independently
4. Use canary deployments exclusively for API Gateway, while all other components can be deployed directly to production without testing

**Q20:** How should you test the complete gRPC-Web → API Gateway → BFF → Microservice flow?

1. Only unit tests are necessary since integration between components is guaranteed by gRPC's type safety and schema validation
2. Comprehensive testing including unit tests, contract testing, integration testing, and end-to-end flow validation with realistic scenarios
3. Manual testing only, as automated testing cannot accurately simulate the complex interactions between distributed system components
4. Performance testing exclusively, since functional correctness is automatically ensured by Protocol Buffer schema compatibility checking
